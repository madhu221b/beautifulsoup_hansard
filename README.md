Using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to download around 66k documents on https://hansard.parliament.uk/
- Download Chrome Driver based on your environment - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
- My first attempt working with Selenium Driver and BeautifulSoup so what I have is just a working code.
- Future Improvements:
1. Keep a trace history of how many documents have been successfully downloaded.
2. Implementing threading to count files on each download which have been succesfully downloaded.
